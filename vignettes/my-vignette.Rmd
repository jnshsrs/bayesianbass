The diffusion of innovation was described in detail by Rogers' "Innovation Diffusion Theory" in 1962.
This framework describes the uptake of a new product, behavior or idea by the course of adoption over time. 
Later, Bass modelled this course mathematically. The Bass model uses two coefficients to describe the process of adoption, p, the coefficient of innovation and q, the coefficient of imitation.

Both coefficients can be used to investigate and describe the specific patterns of diffusion of innovations. 

Traditionally, this model is fit using methods such as non-linear-least squares.

This package provides functions to apply the Bass model within a Bayesian Framework.
The Bayesian framework offers richer information about the model, e.g. by providing a complete probability distribution over the model parameter as well as the predictions.
Furthermore, the Bayesian model is able to incorporate prior knowledge about the adoption process.

This viginette explains the main functions of the `bayesianbass` package using a recent real world scenario of the uptake of electronic health records in U.S. hospitals.
